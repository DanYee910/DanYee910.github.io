<div class="entry-content"><p>This topic was introduced to me by a friend many months ago, and I find it fascinating in it&rsquo;s importance, simplicity, and also difficulty.  Random numbers, surely something so simple  doesn&rsquo;t warrant your time to read about it.  Here is what happens when fake randomness is figured out:</p>

<p><img src="/images/LARSON16.jpg" alt="Larson" /></p>

<p>Yea he has so much money the dollar sign doesn&rsquo;t even display anymore.</p>

<p>Given the capabilities of computers to solve both small and large problems in all parts of life, at some point there will be a need to simulate randomness.  The problem is computers are very good at following the directions you give them, but by design they are entirely predictable.  Asking a computer to do something truly random, is something they are not designed to do.  True randomness in nature can be found in radioactive decay, radio static, or atmospheric noise.  How do you get a predictable computer to act randomly? Programmers can &ldquo;simulate&rdquo; randomness with complex algorithms to generate numbers that are &ldquo;close&rdquo; to random.</p>

<p>Pseudo-Random Number Generators(PRNGs):  PRNGs are typically built around mathematical algorithms that produce seemingly random sequences of numbers.  PRNGs are very efficient, they can generate large amounts of nearly random numbers in a short length of time.  A &ldquo;seed&rdquo; value is the initial state that is run through the PRNG algorithm to give a &ldquo;random&rdquo; result.  This is important because by their nature, PRNGs are &ldquo;deterministic&rdquo;, if you know the seed that started a sequence you can reproduce it later in time.  In some cases that can be a desirable attribute, for instance you can run the same computer simulation several times if needed.  Another property of PRNGs is &ldquo;periodicity&rdquo;, given enough time a given sequence will reappear which obviously wouldn&rsquo;t be very random.  Well crafted PRNGs have extremely long periods such that this is not a problem.</p>

<p>So to recap, PRNGs are &ldquo;almost random&rdquo;, and are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Efficient - They can generate large amounts of numbers quickly.</li>
<li>Deterministic - Given a known seed they are reproducible.</li>
<li>Periodic - It will eventually repeat itself.</li>
</ul>


<p>While not perfect for every use, PRNGs are a powerful tool that have many applications.  PRNGs are widely used in simulations, models, games, and cryptography.  Cryptography requires PRNGs of a much higher standard, called cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators.  CSPRNGs must not only possess a high degree of near randomness, but the algorithm must be resilient to attack even if the attacker has partial knowledge of the initial state/seed.  That brings up an important point, a PRNG is only as good as it&rsquo;s algorithm, and poorly done PRNGs can lead to disaster.</p>

<p>When PRNGs go wrong, the consequences can be severe.  One of the most infamous examples is the Planet Poker website and it&rsquo;s Texas Holdem game.  With real money at stake, PP&rsquo;s business hinged on being able to produce true randomness like in a casino setting.  The snowball that got everything rolling was PP publishing it&rsquo;s shuffling algorithm to reassure players of it&rsquo;s fairness.  Upon seeing this code, a team of security researchers were convinced it was flawed and set about cracking the RNG behind it.  A real deck of 52 cards has a 52! number of possible shuffles, a staggeringly huge number of possibilities.  PP&rsquo;s algorithm used the clock as a seed, and the researchers realized the algorithm results in only around 200,000 shuffles, while large it is nowhere near as large as 52 real cards.  They created a program that takes the player&rsquo;s 2 known cards, plus the 3 revealed cards from the flop.  Knowing only those 5 cards, the program searched through the 200,000 possible shuffles to find the initial state.  Once found, the program could determine every other player&rsquo;s hand, as well as the upcoming turn and river cards.  A PRNG doesn&rsquo;t get anymore cracked than that.  The researchers went public with their findings, and Planet Poker was publicly humilated.

<p>I hope this cursory look at randomness and PRNGs is useful to you.  Whether you know it or not, PRNGs are everywhere.  Randomness is a simple concept, yet creating randomness is incredibly complex with massive amounts of money and research spent trying to do it right.  The consequences of poor randomness ensure that research into PRNGs will always continue.  Every time I play a game online and players blow off some unlikely occurrence with &ldquo;eh&hellip;RNG is RNG&rdquo;, I just think about Planet Poker and how that statement could very well be wrong.  Can you imagine playing against a player who knows all the cards that are out and what&rsquo;s coming?</p>
