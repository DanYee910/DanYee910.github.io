<div class="entry-content"><p>Diablo 2 was my introduction into Action RPGs.  I played Diablo 2 and several mods of it off and on for probably over 10 years, longer than any other game by a mile.  Looking back I think one of the prime factors that kept me playing for so long was the item/loot system.  It is my belief that one can truly write a book on the subject, it is a complex subject and opinions abound.  I want to take a glancing look at what made the loot as addictive as it was <em>for me personally</em>, because in my opinion there are still many lessons to be learned.</p>

<h2>The good:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Base item variety</li>
</ul>


<p>In just the base item classes there is already a large variety before any rolled attributes even come into play.  There isn’t simply a “bow” but an entire collection of bows, of varying level, damage range, attack speed, and requirements.  This alone already gives you a choice between hitting fast and light, or hitting slow and hard, and everything in between.  Bows with low Strength requirement might also be desirable, because you can conserve more stat points for Dexterity which is more useful with bows.</p>

<p>Similarly, armor slots also varied in stats.  Leather type armors provided less defense but also lower strength requirements.  The highest end metal plated armors provided huge defense but could also give you a move speed penalty.  Spellcasters can get away with light leather armor but a Barbarian would seek a solid piece of defensive armor.  This balancing act and tug of war between base item stats is just the beginning.  I believe it shows immediately the philosophy behind the item system of providing choices for different play styles.  Arguably a not too glamorous part of the game but attention to detail here was very impressive.</p>

<ul>
<li>Offensive attribute variety</li>
</ul>


<p>One thing I miss from D2 was the sheer amount of useful item attributes, both offensive, defensive, and supportive.  Offensively there was a slew of usual damage and attack speed mods, but you can augment it in so many ways with other attributes.  Aura on equipment, skill passives, chance to proc curses, crushing blow, deadly strike, -% target defense, the list goes on and on.  You would be hard pressed to fit all of it, but you were free to choose which ones you wanted to concentrate on.</p>

<ul>
<li>Damage mitigation strategies</li>
</ul>


<p>Defensively, I have yet to play a game that offered so many layers of defense.  Defense, hit points, dodge, block, damage reduction %, and flat damage reduction.  It was a challenge becoming the tankiest hero while keeping solid damage output, but it was certainly possible.  The damage mitigation potential was excellent and a tank truly felt like a tank.  A problem many games have is with increased difficulty being equated to “damage spikes”.  It’s not interesting to get wiped out in one shot from a boss, and damage mitigation is an area a lot of other games feel very weak and underdeveloped in.</p>

<ul>
<li>The high end: Set vs. Unique vs. Runeword</li>
</ul>


<p>Min maxing aside, I feel the game eventually got to a point that allowed a lot of flexibility in how to gear oneself.  While as a general rule you could say one item type was better than the other, there was significant overlap in power level between sets, uniques, and runewords that made choosing between them less clear cut.  There is usually a consensus over which setup is &ldquo;best&rdquo;, but I think D2 also allowed for many slightly less optimal but still viable choices.  It was very possible for non-cookie cutter builds to get their fair share of the action.</p>

<ul>
<li>Reasonably tight ranges on the random number generator</li>
</ul>


<p>Mostly in regard to unique items and runewords, they were difficult enough to obtain and still had random attribute rolls.  The stat ranges however were reasonably tuned most of the time.  Even with bad rolls the item itself was still plenty usable.  Of course the quest for the perfect item never ends, but being content with equipment found on the way made it more palatable.  It is a different story if the item dropped once in a blue moon, and you rolled +1 all skills when the item could potentially have +3.  “RNG is RNG” is something I read on forums from time to time, I think D2 hit a fair balance between randomness and flat out insulting the player.</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple Set/Unique drops on big bosses</li>
</ul>


<p>Loot explosions that cut out a lot of the crap and got right to business.  You could expect to see maybe 6 items, and theres a pretty solid chance to find some green and gold in there, maybe even multiples.  The question is are the green and gold items going to be the good ones.  I think that is much more exciting that seeing a pile of blue and yellow vendor trash time after time with a thin chance of a higher grade, something that feels almost endemic in some games.</p>

<ul>
<li>Items that were more than stat sticks</li>
</ul>


<p>I have yet to find a game that does this as well as D2.  Quite a number of items stood on their own or complemented character skills that they could form the centerpiece of new builds.  My favorite probably being the interaction of Freezing Arrow with pierce and cold damage mods from items.  It became a question less of “what is the biggest amount of some stat I can get” and more of a “does this combination of mods work really well with my build”.  It made for much more interesting decision making.</p>

<ul>
<li>Magic find item mods clearly helped</li>
</ul>


<p>Sometimes I really have to wonder with games if item find boosting properties even work at all.  With drop rates poor enough, turning 0.0001% to 0.0004% drop rate was indistinguishable, so why bother.  It was abundantly clear with D2 that Magic Find was real and working.  It was a real decision to balance Magic Find and killing speed on characters.  Many players geared characters with massive amounts of Magic Find to the detriment of their survivability.  Maybe not the best choice, but certainly a valid choice.  Most games I completely ignore such mods.</p>

<h2>The not so good:</h2>

<p>Now all that said, D2 had it&rsquo;s faults as well.  Some games have since implemented their own fixes for these issues.  Parts I found less than desirable:</p>

<ul>
<li>Non-scalable item levels.</li>
</ul>


<p>A biggie.  Uniques were designed at a specific level, and only that level.  If a unique has great mods but it’s a level 29 unique, you’re going to have think real hard about replacing it at level 80 no matter how much you like the mods.  For rares and magics, the attributes available grew stronger as higher level items dropped.  However sets, runewords, and uniques did not scale according to level.  In essence, that gigantic pool of so many uniques is realistically smaller because by the end of the game so many of them are simply obsolete.  Marvel Heroes instituted item level scaling on all Uniques, this decision makes it possible for all Uniques in the game to drop and be competitive at any level.</p>

<ul>
<li>Durability and consumed arrows</li>
</ul>


<p>These item properties have thankfully disappeared in most games I have played since.  They add a little thematic flavor to the game, at the expense of smooth gameplay.  I think the choice to ditch these in favor of better gameplay is the correct one.  They took a lot of “action” out of ARPG.</p>

<ul>
<li>Backpack Tetris</li>
</ul>


<p>Great swords take a 2x4 inventory space while a ring took up 1x1, oh the pain…  Many of the more recent ARPGs make items in stash of a uniform size.  A ring takes up the same amount of space as a Halberd.  It greatly simplifies inventory management which I think is excellent.  D2’s rapid pace of item drops led to a lot of shuffling of items around to try and line up empty squares to fit items in.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lack of stackable consumables.</li>
</ul>


<p>One of the biggest advances in ARPG items…  D2 had no stackable potions, item stacks have made there way into pretty much all of the recent ARPGs thank god.  One of the first things I relished when playing D2 mods was the increased stack on keys and scrolls.  Definitely a quality of life shortcoming that has been recognized and rectified since.</p>

<ul>
<li>Unidentified everything</li>
</ul>


<p>Magics and rares both came unidentified every single time.  Item identification is another thematically fitting property, but one which again interrupts the flow of gameplay.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ethereal items</li>
</ul>


<p>Items that will eventually break permanently, with a few possible workarounds…  Not my favorite mechanic.  You have no control over what ends up as ethereal either.</p>

<h2>Conclusions.</h2>

<p>At the time I was simply blown away at the depth of how D2 handled it’s items.  Some of the mechanics are clearly dated, but a lot of it still holds up even today.</p>

<p>There is a lot of good to take away from the game.  A lot of the points above came to mind because they are things I still see lacking in &ldquo;modern&rdquo; games.  Even now, a lot of random item systems feel pretty sparse when compared with what D2 used 10 years ago.  On one hand I am glad to see many of the least desirable mechanics left behind, but at the same time I haven’t seen an item system that can stand alongside D2&rsquo;s 15 year old system.</p>
